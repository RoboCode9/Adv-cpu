Create a class named “Taxpayer”.
•	Data fields for Taxpayer class include the Social Security number (usea string for the type, but do not use dashes within the number), the yearly grossincome, the tax owed, and totalTaxAmt (static variable).
•	The class includes the properties with get and set for the first twodata fields, but make the tax owed a read-only property. The tax should becalculated whenever the income is set. Assume the tax is 15% of income forincomes under $30,000 and 28% for incomes that are $30,000 or higher. After thetax owed is calculated, the tax owed is added into totalTaxAmt.
Write a main function that prompts user to enter the number of Taxpayer and creates a dynamic array of the Taxpayer objects. Prompt the user for data for each object and display total tax amount. After the main function, write a function that compare each object based on tax owed; then display the objects in order by the amount of tax owed. Save the program as TaxPayerDemo.cs.
